# SEOIntel Admin Panel

Admin routes live under `/admin`:

- `/admin`
- `/admin/users`
- `/admin/audits`
- `/admin/queue`
- `/admin/workers`
- `/admin/settings`
- `/admin/plans`

## Assign Admin

Set this server-side env var on Vercel:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAILS=owner@example.com,ops@example.com
```

When one of those users signs in, the server-side profile bootstrap sets:

- `role=admin`
- `plan=admin`
- `subscription_status=active`

Do not expose `ADMIN_EMAILS` to browser code.

## Manage Users

Admins can:

- Search users by email.
- Change role: `user`, `support`, `admin`.
- Change plan: `free`, `paid`, `agency`, `admin`.
- Change subscription status.
- Reset quotas.

All user changes are logged in `admin_actions`.

## Manage Audits

Admins can:

- View latest audits.
- Filter visually by status, plan, mode, user, and error.
- Cancel queued/running audits.
- Retry failed audits.
- Recover stale locked audits.
- Raise or lower queue priority.

## Inspect Queue

The queue page shows queued/running audits ordered by:

1. Highest `queue_priority`.
2. Oldest `created_at`.

## Inspect Workers

The workers page reads `platform_settings` rows keyed as `audit_worker:*` and shows:

- workerId
- status
- lastSeenAt
- currentAuditId
- runtime
- supported modes
- stale/sleeping warning

If no heartbeat exists, deploy the Render Web Service worker and verify `https://seointel-audit-worker.onrender.com/health`. Uptime monitors must ping only that worker health URL; do not ping the SEOIntel homepage or audit start routes such as `/api/tools/audit/start`.

## Settings

Safe settings include:

- platform name
- support email
- queue fairness paid burst
- guest audit enabled

Secrets are never displayed or editable in the admin panel.

## Plans

The plans page edits `plan_limits`:

- daily/monthly quotas
- page limits
- allowed modes
- priority
- export/PDF/white-label/embed/API flags

Run `supabase/migrations/003_plans_admin_limits.sql` before using the panel.
