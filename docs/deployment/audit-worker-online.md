# Crawlio Online Audit Worker

The live site needs three separate parts:

1. Vercel frontend and lightweight API routes.
2. Supabase Postgres and Realtime.
3. An online Node audit worker running outside Vercel.

Vercel creates queued audit rows and returns an audit ID immediately. The worker claims those queued rows from Supabase, crawls public pages with resource-light fetches, writes live events/pages/issues/reports, and refreshes its lease while it works. If the worker is not running or a free Render web service is asleep, audits remain queued until it wakes.

## Free vs Paid Behavior

- Free: Quick Audit only, 5 pages, low concurrency, lightweight SEO checks, passive security headers, JSON export.
- Paid: Quick and Standard audits, up to 50 successfully analysed pages, higher queue priority, deeper SEO categories, PDF/report features.
- Agency/Admin: Quick, Standard, and Deep when a dedicated worker enables `DEEP_AUDIT_ENABLED=true`.

Deep Audit is disabled on the Render Free Web Service workaround by default because free web services can sleep and should run low resource workloads only.

## Required Supabase Step

Run this migration in the Supabase SQL Editor before deploying the worker:

```sql
-- Paste and run supabase/migrations/002_worker_heartbeat.sql
```

This adds `platform_settings.value jsonb` for worker heartbeat rows keyed as `audit_worker:<workerId>`.

## Required Worker Environment

Set these on the worker service only:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
AUDIT_WORKER_ID=worker-production-1
AUDIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=4000
```

Optional:

```bash
WORKER_HEALTH_PORT=3000
```

Never set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in browser code. Never create `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Vercel should only use client-safe browser vars plus the server-side vars needed by lightweight API routes.

## Expected Worker Logs

```text
Crawlio audit worker started as worker-production-1
Supabase admin: connected
Supabase project: xxxxx.supabase.co
Polling interval: 4000ms
```

During operation:

```text
No queued audits found
Claimed audit <auditId> for <normalizedUrl>
Audit <auditId> running
Audit <auditId> completed
```

## Render Free Web Service

Render Free Web Service is the recommended MVP workaround because it exposes `/health` and `/ready`.

1. Push `main` to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a new Blueprint or Web Service from the GitHub repo.
3. If using the Blueprint, select `render.yaml`.
4. Confirm:

```bash
Build Command: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
Start Command: npm run worker:audit
```

5. Add worker env vars:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
AUDIT_WORKER_ID=worker-production-1
AUDIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=4000
WORKER_RUNTIME=render-web-service
DEEP_AUDIT_ENABLED=false
```

6. Deploy the service and watch logs for the expected startup lines.
7. From local terminal, verify heartbeat:

```bash
npm run check:worker
```

8. Start a Quick Audit on the Vercel preview or production site. The audit should move from queued to running and show live events.

9. Add an uptime monitor that pings only the Render worker health endpoint:

```text
https://seointel-audit-worker.onrender.com/health
```

Ping every 10 minutes. Do not point uptime monitors at the Crawlio homepage, Vercel preview/production URLs, or audit start routes such as `/api/tools/audit/start`. Render Free Web Service may sleep without traffic, so queued audits can wait until `/health` wakes the worker.

Admin bootstrap:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAILS=owner@example.com,ops@example.com
```

Set `ADMIN_EMAILS` on Vercel so the server-side profile bootstrap can assign `role=admin` and `plan=admin`.

## Railway

Use the included `railway.json`.

1. Create a Railway project from the GitHub repo.
2. Add the same worker env vars.
3. Confirm the deploy start command:

```bash
npm run worker:audit
```

4. Deploy and verify with:

```bash
npm run check:worker
```

## Docker

Build and run with the worker Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.worker -t crawlio-audit-worker .
docker run --rm \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co \
  -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key \
  -e AUDIT_WORKER_ID=worker-production-1 \
  -e AUDIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=4000 \
  crawlio-audit-worker
```

Do not bake `.env` files into the image. `.dockerignore` excludes local env files, `node_modules`, `dist`, and Vercel/Supabase local folders.

## VPS

Install Node LTS, clone the repo, then run:

```bash
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key \
AUDIT_WORKER_ID=worker-production-1 \
AUDIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=4000 \
npm run worker:audit
```

Use a process manager such as systemd or PM2 so the worker restarts after crashes or deploys.

## Diagnostics

Check worker heartbeat and latest audit statuses:

```bash
npm run check:worker
```

List recent queued/running audits:

```bash
npm run check:queued-audits
```

If audits stay queued forever, check:

- Worker service is deployed and running.
- Worker has `SUPABASE_URL`.
- Worker has `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- Worker and Vercel use the same Supabase project.
- `supabase/migrations/002_worker_heartbeat.sql` was run.
- Supabase Realtime is enabled for audit tables from migration 001.
- The worker logs do not show startup env refusal.
- Stale locked jobs have an expired lease and can be reclaimed.

Environment changes require redeployment. The crawler must not run inside Vercel serverless request paths.
