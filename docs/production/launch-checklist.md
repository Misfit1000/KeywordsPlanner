# Controlled Free Beta Launch Checklist

## Required before deployment

- Back up the Supabase database and record the restore point.
- Apply migrations 001 through 011 in numeric order; never edit an applied migration.
- Configure Vercel browser variables and server-only Supabase variables in their correct scopes.
- Configure the Render audit engine with the same release commit and server-only variables.
- Set a random `RATE_LIMIT_HASH_SECRET`; never expose it through a `VITE_` variable.
- Confirm `/api/version`, the protected admin compatibility panel, and the audit-engine `/health` endpoint agree.
- Keep `captchaRequired` off until a matching browser Turnstile widget and secret are configured.
- Complete the legal owner name, monitored support contact, address, jurisdiction, and formal notice details before promoting beyond a controlled beta.

## Release verification

1. Run CI and the repository validation suite.
2. Deploy the frontend/API and audit engine from the same commit.
3. Open the manual production-smoke workflow without audit creation.
4. Confirm version compatibility and queue polling.
5. Run one audit of the SEOIntel-owned production domain and confirm a terminal state.
6. Verify account export, audit deletion, and a test-account deletion.
7. Check CSP, browser console, mobile widths, keyboard navigation, and dark/light themes.

## Scope deliberately postponed

Oracle deployment, paid-worker routing, multi-worker infrastructure, Stripe Checkout, Stripe webhooks, billing portal, and payment processing remain future work. Do not configure or advertise them as active.

## Known SEO delivery limitation

Public blog routes are currently rendered by the Vite client after the application loads. The sitemap and client metadata are truthful, but SEOIntel does not claim server-rendered article HTML. Add prerendering or server rendering in a separate reviewed change before relying on consistent crawler rendering for editorial growth.
